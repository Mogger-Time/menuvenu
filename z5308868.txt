Week 1
* Formed our group and named it "MOG".
* Anthony and I attended the tutorial and read through the project ideas. We brainstormed some novel functionalities for a couple of the projects which we were interested in.
* Ronald was selected to be the scrum master.
* I created the Jira site and invited fellow team members and our mentor.
* Finalised the project idea: Wait Management System. 

Week 2
* As a team we decided on our techstack: frontend - React.js, backend - Python, PostgreSQL.
* We brainstormed our novel and non-novel functionalities, and sought advice from our tutor.

Week 3
* We worked on the proposal for this week. I was in charge of designing a majority of the storyboards using Adobe xD.
* We ran into some complications with having too many features. This was before we realised that some of our 6 non-novel functionalities could come from the Wait Staff Management specification.
* Ronald submitted the proposal for the group before the deadline.  

Week 4
* This week I worked on the frontend for calling staff assistance and the billing pop up.
* I also went ahead and started the wait staff interface as I had mistakenly thought that the wait staff side of assistance required was part of the user story we had allocated for this sprint.
* I learned how to test our project using Docker and helped with fixing bugs related to my assigned parts.

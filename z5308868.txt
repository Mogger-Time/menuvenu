Week 1
* Formed our group and named it "MOG".
* Anthony and I attended the tutorial and read through the project ideas. We brainstormed some novel functionalities for a couple of the projects which we were interested in.
* Ronald was selected to be the scrum master.
* I created the Jira site and invited fellow team members and our mentor.
* Finalised the project idea: Wait Management System. 

Week 2
* As a team we decided on our techstack: frontend - React.js, backend - Python, PostgreSQL.
* We brainstormed our novel and non-novel functionalities, and sought advice from our tutor.

Week 3
* We worked on the proposal for this week. I was in charge of designing a majority of the storyboards using Adobe xD.
* We ran into some complications with having too many features. This was before we realised that some of our 6 non-novel functionalities could come from the Wait Staff Management specification.
* Ronald submitted the proposal for the group before the deadline.  

Week 4
* This week I worked on the frontend for calling staff assistance and the billing pop up.
* I also went ahead and started the wait staff interface as I had mistakenly thought that the wait staff side of assistance required was part of the user story we had allocated for this sprint.
* I learned how to test our project using Docker and helped with fixing bugs related to my assigned parts.

Week 5
* During our lab this week we had presented our Sprint 1 progress in Demo A. The tutor provided us with positive feedback and suggested that we work on improving the UI for the next sprint and to let him know during the next class about what we want to do for Sprint 2/3, as we were still deciding for a couple of user stories. 
* We had our Retrospective A meeting to reflect on how our first sprint went and to discuss what we could do for Sprint 2. In this meeting we also delegated user stories for each person to work on.
* Ronald submitted the finalised Retrospective A report for the team before the deadline.

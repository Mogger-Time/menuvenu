Week 1
We decided on the name MOG for our group

I decided to do backend!

Week 2
As a team, we decided to use
python for backend,
react for frontend,
and postgreSQL for database
All of us came up with functionalities in regards of different systems to integrate it with the wait management system
I created sprints within jira, 3 2-week sprints so that we can start creating user stories 

Week 3
After we created all the user stories, I decided to start working on the backend authentication routes
I created the base file structure of the project and pushed it into github first so that my teammates can work on different parts of the code
User authentication routes were finished before the lab 
I started working on using Docker to containerize the backend
